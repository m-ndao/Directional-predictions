# ðŸ“ˆ Directional Prediction of Stock Indexes: DJIA vs. Russell 2000 Using Econometric and Machine Learning Models

This project analyzes and forecasts the **directional movement** (up/down) of two major U.S. stock indexes â€” the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)** and the **Russell 2000 (RUT)** â€” using **econometric models** (Logit, Probit) and **machine learning algorithms** (Random Forest, SVM). The goal is to evaluate model accuracy and build a trading strategy based on forecasted trends.

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

- **Time Period**: February 1999 â€“ December 2019  
- **Target Variables**:
  - `dji` = 1 if DJIA return is positive, 0 otherwise
  - `rti` = 1 if RUT return is positive, 0 otherwise
- **Approaches Used**:
  - Econometric Models: Logistic Regression, Probit Regression (with and without lag terms)
  - Machine Learning: Random Forest (basic and depth-based), Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Outcome**: Suggested trading strategy using directional forecasts and macroeconomic indicators.
